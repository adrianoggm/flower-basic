"""Dataset loaders for federated learning.

This module provides standardized dataset loaders for various physiological
and biomedical datasets used in federated learning research.

Available datasets:
- ECG5000: Time series classification for ECG signals (⚠️ DEPRECATED)
- WESAD: Wearable Stress and Affect Detection dataset (physiological signals)
- SWELL: Stress and Workload in Knowledge Work dataset (multimodal)

All loaders follow consistent interfaces and provide:
- Type-safe implementations with comprehensive type hints
- Stratified train/test splitting
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Subject-based data partitioning for federated scenarios
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
